## Nerd stuff

### Terrain generation techniques

`Thoth`'s terrain generation follows an 8-layer deterministic pipeline where every `(seed, geologicTime)` pair creates a unique world.

#### Layer 1: Noise base

[Kurt Spencer's successor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSimplex_noise) to Perlin and Simplex noise, [OpenSimplex2](https://github.com/KdotJPG/OpenSimplex2) was chosen for `Thoth` given its visual isotropy and lack of directional artefacts.

Aside from OpenSimplex2, other noise functions implemented were fBm, ridge, and domain-warp modulators. Multi-octave sampling also fed the tectonic mask and were used for uplift and continental heightfield when generating the base terrain fold.

#### Layer 2: Plate tectonics

To simulate proper tectonic movement, `Thoth` implemented a plate mosaic layer with [per-plate velocities, age, and boundary flags](./src/worldgen.lua) to drive uplift belts, island arcs and and passive-margin shelves. 

This general approach was taken from [PlaTec / Viitanen (2012) approach to physically based plate-tectonic terrain synthesis](https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/40422/Viitanen_Lauri_2012_03_30.pdf) and the [large-scale uplift + fluvial model of Cordonnier et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.12820).

#### Layer 3: Mountain orometry

`Thoth`'s orometry currently blends 6 archetypes *(alps, appalachians, himalaya, andes, fjordland, basinrange)* with standard techniques that include the below. This reference is supported by the approach taken in [orometry-based terrain analysis + synthesis framework of Argudo et al. 2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3355089.3356535) and [Kirmse & de Ferranti 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0309133317738163).

* Peak-amplitude
* Ridge-frequency
* Relief scales
* Orometric descriptors *(prominence, isolation, ridges, saddles)*

#### Layer 4: Hydrology

`Thoth` attempts to implement hydrology via a heap-based system, which is a straight rip-off of [Priority-Flood depression filling pass (Barnes, Lehman & Mulla 2014)](https://rbarnes.org/sci/2014_depressions.pdf) and [D8 downstream routing (O'Callaghan & Mark 1984)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0734189X84800110).

***TLDR***, we added flow accumulation *(computed in reverse-topological order)* to allow for natural generation of waterbodies that include basins, watersheds, terminal cells and lake surfaces.

#### Layer 5: Fluvial erosion

To simulate erosion in `Thoth`, I referenced the research in [stream-power incision law (Whipple & Tucker 1999)](http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~kite/doc/Whipple_and_Tucker_1999.pdf) that integrated a debris-flow branch. This branch switches to a critical-slope equilibrium above a sediment-concentration threshold to allow for relatively realistic *(albeit unoptimised)* erosion mechanics.

#### Layer 6: Glacial erosion

Ice-sheet abrasion is roughly driven by the ideas covered in [Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021RG000754) to attempt a rudimentary simulation of basal sliding and gradient-driven flow.

#### Layer 7: Hillslopes and periglacial

To add some degree of slopes, `Thoth` implements a non-linear critical-slope diffusion. Geographical difference are simulated via 2 separate regolith and bedrock diffusivities. 

#### Layer 8: Climate and biomes

Given I really wanted `Thoth` to be a somewhat accurate simulation of earth's actual terrain and weather mechanics, I referenced [Smith & Barstad 2004 linear theory of orographic precipitation](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/61/12/1520-0469_2004_061_1377_altoop_2.0.co_2.xml) to map temperature against precipitation onto a Whittaker-style grid. 

Furthering this notion of realistic weather, `Thoth` carried over [Köppen-Geiger](https://www.britannica.com/science/Koppen-climate-classification) letters to resolve orographic precipitation with wind-gradient lift. 

Finally, some sembelance of soil realism is implemented via USDA soil orders *(entisol, inceptisol, mollisol, vertisol, aridisol, histosol, spodosol, oxisol, andisol, ultisol)*, which directly ties into the aforementioned erosion mechanics.

### Rendering 

Heightfields are drawn through [GPU-based geometry clipmaps (Losasso & Hoppe 2004)](https://hhoppe.com/proj/gpugcm/) in [`src/clipmap.lua`](./src/clipmap.lua) with persistent streamed meshes and per-cell sun-direction lighting. A low-resolution canvas + 32-colour palette-quantisation shader in [`src/postfx.lua`](./src/postfx.lua) is swapped per active view-scope for the [Proteus](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219680/Proteus/) look. [`src/atmosphere.lua`](./src/atmosphere.lua) drives a four-grade dawn/noon/dusk/night day cycle × four seasons, tinting the palette and the sun vector.

### Performance optimisation

#### Streaming and LOD

`Thoth` implements geometry clipmaps to cache nested regular grids around the camera. This means that only ring-buffer edges are re-uploaded as the player walks to keep the rendering rate steady even at large world sizes. 

As with everything above, this is taken from the [Losasso & Hoppe 2004](https://hhoppe.com/proj/gpugcm/) invariant, and is not an idea that came to me naturally. 

#### Async hydrology worker

Getting into the nitty-gritty, `Thoth`'s worker offloads priority-flood and climate rendering to a background LÖVE2D thread over a job-to-response channel to ensure that the render thread never blocks.

#### Two-tier hydrology resolution

Since water is often the most graphically intensive element of real-world games, especially when it comes to realistic terrain generation, `Thoth` has a dual-workflow system that allows for both fine-grained regions to pass *(on local flows)* while a coarser basin pass simultaneously preserves large river corridors and inter-basin spillovers cheaply. 

### Benchmarks

`Thoth` currently has 2 different benchmarking layers.

1. **Micro-benchmarks**: [`tests/bench.lua`](./tests/bench.lua) generates worlds at scope $\times$ chunk-radius combinations $\times$ region / basin / erosion / climate solves. This also gates against [`tests/bench.baseline.json`](./tests/bench.baseline.json) while `make bench` fails on regressions worse than the tolerance *(50% locally, 10% in CI)*.
2. **Runtime smoke**: `make walk-smoke` runs a headless `love . --walk-smoke --walk-smoke-frames 240 --perf-interval 0.5` traversal. Seperately, streaming perf samples every 0.5 seconds so first-render and walk-hitch regressions surface without a monitor. Finally, `make render-smoke` and `make export-smoke` cover render init + map-export paths respectively.
